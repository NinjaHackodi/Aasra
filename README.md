For MPSTME hack-n-code 2.0 2018
Our topic for the MPSTME Hack-n-code 2.0 was to make a website for motivating and changing the minds of the people who are having thoughts about committing suicide.
The AASRA foundation which was a partner in this hackathon works towards the above cause and to prevent people from commiting suicide.
In our website we have highlighted all the crucial things in life, one may find worth living for. For instance, one's spouse,parents, kids, etc.
We have made use of joyous colours and optimistic quotes in order to cheer up the person. We also have provided the contact number of various NGOs, therapists and clinics which may help these individuals overcome this phase of their life and lead a better and a fruitful life.
Our team comprised of Heeket Mehta, Harshil Jhaveri and Ankit Gupta.
We focussed mainly on the frontend to provide a cheerful and euphoric user interface so that it cheers up the users and lightens their mood.
JQuery, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap were used to design the frontend of the website and we have incorporated motivating and cheerful quotes using a backend database.
For the backend development of the website, we have used Django in Python to create the database for storing the quote and displaying new and optimistic quotes. 
We have deliberlately not added the login page, since we do not want our users to undergo the trouble of logging in under such stressful conditions and unpleasant ordeals.
Thus, we have made this website an open for all website without any login page, so that anyone can access our website at any time without having to confirm their identity and filling their details during such unpleasant times. 
Pictures of families, friends , parents, etc. may help the user find a cause to live for and bring hope into his life, so that he has soemthing to look forward to. Any such distractions may help save myriad lives and treatment of such individuals will eventually help the overcome this phase of their lives and lead better, meaningful , full and joyous lives.
